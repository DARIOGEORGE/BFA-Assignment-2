## ANSWER:



## 1.1 What is Budgeting?

**Definition**: Budgeting is the process of preparing a detailed financial plan for a specific period (usually one year), which estimates income, expenditure, and resource allocation.

### Steps in Budgeting

| Step | Description                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Set objectives (financial and operational goals)    |
| 2    | Identify available resources (capital, labor, etc.) |
| 3    | Estimate revenues and expenditures                  |
| 4    | Prepare departmental budgets                        |
| 5    | Consolidate into a master budget                    |
| 6    | Approval and communication of the budget            |
| 7    | Implementation and monitoring                       |

### Types of Budgets

| Type             | Description                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Operating Budget | Day-to-day expenses and income (e.g., sales, salaries) |
| Capital Budget   | Long-term investments in fixed assets                  |
| Cash Budget      | Cash inflows and outflows                              |
| Master Budget    | Combined summary of all functional budgets             |
| Flexible Budget  | Adjusts according to activity levels                   |

## 1.2 What is Budgetary Control?

**Definition**: Budgetary control is the process of comparing actual performance with the budgeted figures and taking corrective action to achieve the organizational goals.

### Steps in Budgetary Control

| Step | Description                      |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | Preparation of budgets           |
| 2    | Recording of actual performance  |
| 3    | Comparison and variance analysis |
| 4    | Identify reasons for deviation   |
| 5    | Take corrective measures         |

### Benefits of Budgetary Control

* Helps in cost control and efficiency
* Facilitates coordination among departments
* Encourages forward planning
* Provides performance benchmarks
* Aids in decision-making

### Example of Budgetary Control

| Particulars     | Budgeted (₹) | Actual (₹) | Variance (₹) | Remark      |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Sales Revenue   | 5,00,000     | 4,80,000   | -20,000      | Unfavorable |
| Production Cost | 3,00,000     | 2,90,000   | +10,000      | Favorable   |
| Net Profit      | 2,00,000     | 1,90,000   | -10,000      | Unfavorable |

# Capital Budgeting Techniques

## What is Capital Budgeting?

**Definition**: Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating and selecting long-term investments that are consistent with the goal of wealth maximization.

### Key Objectives

* Evaluate profitability and risk
* Select the best investment among alternatives
* Optimize capital allocation

## Capital Budgeting Techniques

### 2.1 Payback Period

**Definition**: Time required to recover the initial investment.

**Formula**:

```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Inflow
```

**Example**:

* Initial Investment = ₹1,00,000
* Annual Inflow = ₹25,000
* Payback = ₹1,00,000 / ₹25,000 = 4 years

✅ Simple, but ignores time value of money and post-payback returns.

---

### 2.2 Net Present Value (NPV)

**Definition**: Difference between present value of cash inflows and outflows, using a discount rate.

**Formula**:

```
NPV = Σ (R_t / (1 + r)^t) - C0
```

Where:

* R\_t = Cash inflow at time t
* r = Discount rate
* C0 = Initial investment

**Example**:

* Investment = ₹50,000
* Inflow = ₹20,000 for 3 years
* Discount rate = 10%

```
NPV = 20000/(1.1)^1 + 20000/(1.1)^2 + 20000/(1.1)^3 - 50000 ≈ ₹2,487
```

✅ Considers time value of money and total profitability.

---

### 2.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Definition**: Discount rate at which NPV = 0

**Decision Rule**: Accept project if IRR > cost of capital

**Example**:

* IRR = 15%, Cost of capital = 12% → Project is accepted.

✅ Considers time value; best for ranking projects.

---

### 2.4 Profitability Index (PI)

**Definition**: Ratio of present value of inflows to initial investment.

**Formula**:

```
PI = PV of Inflows / Initial Investment
```

**Example**:

* PV of inflows = ₹60,000
* Investment = ₹50,000
* PI = 60,000 / 50,000 = 1.2 → Accept

✅ Helps when capital is limited; good for project comparison.

### Comparison Table

| Technique      | Time Value | Risk   | Simplicity | Decision Focus       |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Payback Period | ❌ No       | ❌ Low  | ✅ High     | Recovery Time        |
| NPV            | ✅ Yes      | ✅ High | ❌ Moderate | Wealth Maximization  |
| IRR            | ✅ Yes      | ✅ High | ❌ Complex  | Rate of Return       |
| PI             | ✅ Yes      | ✅ High | ❌ Moderate | Value per ₹ Invested |

### Benefits of Capital Budgeting

* Rational decision-making
* Efficient allocation of resources
* Long-term profitability
* Reduces financial risks
